In NLP_1 project file I have tried to classify blogs into three large categories in line of age bracket.After that I've developed an NLP classifier which can use input text parameter to determine the labels of the blog. 
In NLP_2 project file first part deals with scentiment analysis based on IMDB dataset second part dealt with sarcasm detection on twitter data which has been collected from theonion.com and huffingtonpost.com
